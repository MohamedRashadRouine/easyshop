## Introduction

### Evolution of E-commerce

Over the years, electronic commerce has emerged as a major catalyst for change, redefining how businesses interact with their customers. EasyShop Tej Chasse aligns with this trend, utilizing technological advancements to create an exceptional online shopping experience for hunting enthusiasts in Tunisia.

### Increasing Demand for Customized E-commerce Solutions

With the proliferation of small businesses, the demand for tailored and effective e-commerce solutions has never been stronger. EasyShop Tej Chasse responds to this demand by offering a specialized platform crafted for the Tunisian hunting market, going beyond simple online sales to include features specific to hunting and interfaces adapted to the local culture.

### EasyShop Tej Chasse: A Comprehensive Vision

EasyShop Tej Chasse is more than just an online sales platform; it's a vision that transcends traditional commerce boundaries. By creating a dedicated hunting shopping experience, the project aims to connect hunting enthusiasts with quality products, support local small businesses, and contribute to the evolution of e-commerce in Tunisia.

### Project Objectives

EasyShop Tej Chasse aims to create an innovative e-commerce platform that specifically caters to the needs of Tunisian hunters. Combining modern features with a personalized approach, the project seeks to provide an outstanding online shopping experience while contributing to the economic vitality of small businesses in the Tunisian hunting sector.

## Context of the Project

### Introduction

The context of the EasyShop Tej Chasse project, as a dedicated e-commerce platform for the sale of hunting equipment and related clothing, addresses a specific need in the Tunisian market. This chapter provides an in-depth view of the project, highlighting its significance in the e-commerce landscape, especially in the hunting domain.

### Existing Solutions Analysis

The analysis of existing solutions revealed a lack of dedicated options for the online sale of hunting items in Tunisia. Current solutions do not optimally meet the needs of local hunters in terms of accessibility, product diversity, and payment processes.

### Problem Statement

In response to this observation, the EasyShop Tej Chasse project aims to solve the problem of the lack of specialized platforms for online sales of hunting equipment in Tunisia. It seeks to provide a comprehensive, user-friendly solution tailored to the local market.

### Proposed Solution

The proposed solution consists of a robust and flexible e-commerce application developed with React-Bootstrap and Node.js coupled with Firebase. EasyShop Tej Chasse will offer an optimal user experience, a variety of specialized products, secure electronic payment features, and an administration interface for efficient content management.

## Development Methodology

### Comparative Study of Development Methodologies

During the comparative study of development methodologies, three major approaches were examined: Agile, Waterfall, and SCRUM.

#### Agile Methodology

The Agile methodology stands out for its flexibility and adaptability to changes. It promotes close collaboration with clients and allows for quick adjustments in response to market developments.

#### Waterfall Methodology

The Waterfall methodology, although structured, may have limitations in terms of responsiveness to changes. It follows a linear process, which may be less suitable for projects where requirements can evolve rapidly.

#### SCRUM Methodology

The SCRUM methodology was chosen for the EasyShop project due to its flexibility and ability to adapt to frequent changes. SCRUM offers an iterative approach, which is particularly suitable for the development of an e-commerce application.

### Choice of Methodology

The choice of the SCRUM methodology naturally emerged for several reasons. Firstly, SCRUM offers flexibility that aligns perfectly with the evolutionary nature of e-commerce application development. Additionally, SCRUM's ability to effectively manage priority changes and frequent adjustments is a major asset in a dynamic environment. By adopting SCRUM, we commit to an iterative and incremental development approach, fostering constant communication within the team and ensuring continuous adaptation to the changing needs of the market.

## Preliminary Study

This initial stage of the project aims to clearly define the system's needs and establish the foundations for the application's further development.

### Needs Capture

#### Identification of Actors

The main actors identified in the system are visitors, users, and administrators. Each of these actors has specific roles and distinct interactions with the application.
